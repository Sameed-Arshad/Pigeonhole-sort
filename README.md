# Pigeonhole-sort
        This is the implementation of sorting the data using the pigeonhole principle.
        This code is my project.
# Concepts
        First find the minimum and maximum in the given array to get the range.
        The range = max-min+1 which will hepls to find the containers for the objects.
        Now find the key values for the elements fo the given array which will be the position for elements in the containers.
        There is a possibilty that two elements have the same key values.
